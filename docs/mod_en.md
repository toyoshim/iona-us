After this MOD, you will need USB Type A male to Type A male cable for firmware updates.

All you have to do is wire 1P USB connector to PC's USB port.
You should not connect micro USB for power supply because 1P port can do. If you connect micro USB, device or PC may be broken, or burned.
You also don't need to shorten pins for firmware updates.
